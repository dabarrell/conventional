# Conventional

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/conventional`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'conventional'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install conventional
